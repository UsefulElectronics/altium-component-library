# Altium Designer Component Library

### [Tutorial Link](https://youtu.be/62l_jWaxQdU) On [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/wardzx1) 

This Tutorial series is dedicated for learning the basics of Printed Circuit Board design starting from implementing electronics component library until forming PCB fabrication files and making PCB manufacturing order passing through schematics design and PCB layout design.

This playlist will walk you through LoRaWAN based board design that utilizes STM32WLE5CC micro-controller, Li-Ion battery charging circuit, LDR, NTC sensors and optional slot for sensor extension.

In this tutorial, I am sharing my experience in Altium Designer component library formation. minimized schematics and footprint library type is used along the journey of LoRaWAN based board design. It is always a plus for electronics engineer to have good commands in component library management.
